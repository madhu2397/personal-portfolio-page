### User Stories

#### User Story 1
As this is the first time you will be creating a full-fledged web page, we recommend you to set up your laptop with the IDE. You can use any IDE but we recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is freely available. You can go through a quick setup guide available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for all operating systems.

#### User Story 2
Now that you have setup the IDE and ready to roll let us start building the web page.

Start a new project and create a new file `index.html` in the same.

Add the following HTML code to get started
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>


</body>
</html>
```

Add your own title between the `<title>` tags

*The above code is the boilerplate code to be included everytime you create an HTML file for your website.*

Now, create a new file named `style.css` and add the following CSS code to the same to get started. 

```css
* {
    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    max-width: 700px;
    margin: auto;

  }

body {
      min-width: 500px;
      background-color: #e0eeee;
  }
```

*The above code will result in the following page view*

#### User Story 3

In the `<head>` section, link the CSS stylesheet to the HTML file

Use the link tag (`<link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">`)

#### User Story 4
Create a `<div>` tag with class name as 'profileBody' in the HTML file
The add the following styling to the css file 
```css
.profileBody {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: white;
    margin-top: 6px;
    margin-left: 55px;
    width: 75%;
    height: 590px;
  }

```
*Adding the above code should result in the following view:*

(Feel free to play around with the values)

#### User Story 5
